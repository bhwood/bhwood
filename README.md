# Hi there, I'm Billy Hopkinson-Wood 👋

I recently completed a data engineering bootcamp at Northcoders, where I undertook a comprehensive final project. I built an ETL pipeline using AWS Lambda functions, SQL, S3 storage, data lakes, and data warehouses. The project was orchestrated using AWS Step Functions, providing me with hands-on experience in cloud-based data engineering. This endeavor showcased my ability to develop scalable and efficient data solutions.
