**Product Manager building payment dispute prevention tools | Fraud Prevention | Chargeback Management**

I'm a Product Manager at ChargeForwards, where I've built a platform that helps merchants worldwide tackle fraud and resolve disputes before they become chargebacks. My work connects merchants with banks globally through Mastercard, Visa, Amex and Discover, giving them one central place to manage their disputes and fraud alerts.

## üöÄ What I'm Building

**ChargeForwards Platform**: A comprehensive fraud prevention and dispute management system featuring:
- **Global Alert Platform**: Real-time fraud and dispute alerts from banks worldwide
- **Transaction Enrichment**: Digital receipts and enhanced transaction data to prevent friendly fraud
- **Merchant Dashboard**: Clean interface for managing disputes as they happen
- **Integration APIs**: Tools for merchants to connect their payment systems seamlessly

Currently expanding into transaction enrichment, subscription management, and payment acceptance optimisation.
